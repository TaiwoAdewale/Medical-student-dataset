Task

Using the Medical Students Data, create Pivot Tables displaying the following:
Average values for the following for Male and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)
Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places)
Number of students across the different Blood Groups
Number of Students who smoke and those who don’t
Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t

##Solution 
I used the Fill series to fill the Student ID columns, all numerical column was replace with average of each column, 
text column was replaced the mode of each column and BMI column was calculated with ([Weight]/([Height]*[Height]))*10000
